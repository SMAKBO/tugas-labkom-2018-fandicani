<h1>Vitamin A Deficiency</h1>
	<p>Vitamin A Deficiency  (VAD) or hypovitaminosis A is more common in poorer countries, but rarely is seen in more developed countries. Nyctalopia (night blindness) is one of the first signs of VAD. Xerophthalmia (a medical condition in which the eye fails to produce tears), keratomalacia, and complete blindness can also occur.</p>

	<p>Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness, and is critical to achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 to reduce child mortality. About 250,000 to 500,000 malnourished children in the developing world go blind each year from a deficiency of vitamin A, around half of whom die within a year of becoming blind. The United Nations Special Session on Children in 2002 set a goal of the elimination of VAD by 2010.The prevalence of night blindness due to VAD is also high among pregnant women in many developing countries. </p>

	<p>This deficiency can be caused by not consuming enough vitamin A, as well as low levels of iron and zinc. Iron helps vitamin A get absorbed and metabolized by our bodies.  Therefore, a low amount of iron in the body will mean that less vitamin A is absorbed and used from our diet.</p>

	<p>Zinc, on the other hand, helps vitamin A move from the liver to other parts of the body where it is needed. Without zinc, our bodies cannot transfer vitamin A from the liver. Alcohol, liver problems, and diseases affecting the intestines also reduce vitamin A absorption into the body.</p>

	<h3>Warning signs of a Vitamin A Deficiency</h3>
	<p>If one is not getting enough vitamin A, you may experience the following:
		1. Frequent and persistent skin infections
2. Acne, dry and scaly skin
3. Throat infections or mouth ulcers
4. Dandruff and dry hair
5. Sore eyelids and in extreme cases poor vision in the dark (night blindness)
